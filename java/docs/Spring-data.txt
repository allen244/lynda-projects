Spring data is to provide a familiar and consisten, Spring based programming model for data access
while still retaining the special traits of the data store.

-Convert java business entities to presiste target datastore recorded and the revers
-look up records
-update records
-delete records

Repository pattern-
The repository pattern is the abstraction used by Spring Data commons to accomplish these goals. 
It is followed throughout the Spring Data project for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records by citing entities

JPA is a specification, it is not an actual framework. Framework, such as Hibernate and EclipseLink, as well as Java Enterprise Edition compliant application servers provide the implementation. So even if we speak about a Java application that uses JPA, it is actually using another provider following the JPA spec.
 The spec includes metadata declarations to map Java classes, now called entities, to database tables.
