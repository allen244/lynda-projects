Hibernate-Object relation mapping tool ORM- open source
-is a framework that simplifies db access
-data is represented as simple java objects pojo
-Pojo are accessed through a session manager
-Increases productivitiy when data persistency is needed
-Makes persistent database acccess easier

Java application --> Hibernate ---> -->> JTA JDBC JNDI --> DBMS

-Hibernate database access is done thru mapping and configuration
-hides the details of the database schema
-provides more time to concentrate on the business logic
-Includes data query and retrieval operations
-query results are objects instead of sql results sets
-persistency is achived by mapping objects to tables

Hibernate advantages-
-Handles mapping objects to tables using xml or annotations
-Simplate api for storing an retriving data
-db changes only require changes to teh xml
-manages complex table associations
-Reduces db access with smart fetching strategies

Hibernate plugin install in eclipse- hibernate - http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/mars
need to get the drives an add it to eclipse mysql-connector-java-5.1.44-bin

hibernate.cfg.xml- configuration file which connects evrything

Reverse engineering-
Hibrernate uses a colleciton of rules for mapping- object to tables
-type mapping and table filtering-
<schema-selection? tag is used to identify the schema
<table-filter> tag identifies tables to reverse engineer
<type-mapping> section is used to convert types
<table> defines how table reverse engineer
