Static initializer- called the first time anywhere the static is referenced in the application and only called onced

Static initializers are great for initializing the values of complex objects or wherever you need to do any logical operations, 
including evaluating current state of the application before you assign the one and only value to the static object.
 

example
public class OliveJar {

	public static ArrayList<Olive> olives;
	
	static {
		System.out.println("initializing...");
		olives = new ArrayList<>();
		olives.add(new Olive("Kalamata", 0x000000));
		olives.add(new Olive("Picholine", 0x00FF00));
		olives.add(new Olive("Kalamata", 0x000000));
	}

}

non static initializer- will be executed before any constructor methods
-used when executing a class with multiple constructor methods this is a way to make sure code gets initialized

	{
		System.out.println("initializing...");
		olives = new ArrayList<>();
		olives.add(new Olive("Golden", 0xDA9100));
	}
	
Member classes-Encapsulation

 the advantage of member classes is that you can define classes that are available only within the containing class.
In this case, I've made a decision that this class is only relevant and should only be callable from within the OliveJar. Whether you architect your code this way is completely up to you, but Java supports this very strong approach to encapsulation of both data and functionality.
	
	
Local inner classes- only visible within this code block- cannot use static methods or variablses

 you can define these local inner classes, whenever you want to define functionality it's only ever going to be called in this one location,
 it's a way of creating complex functionality, but keeping it hidden from the rest of the application.

	public void reportOlives() {
		class JarLid {
			public void open() {
				System.out.println("Twist, twist, twist...");
				System.out.println("Pop!");
			}
		}
		new JarLid().open();
		
		for (Olive o : olives) {
			System.out.println("It's a " + o.oliveName + " olive!!");
		}
	}
	
annoymous inner class- defined and used once

	public void reportOlives() {

		
		new Object() {
			public void open() {
				System.out.println("Twist, twist, twist...");
				System.out.println("Pop!");
			}
		} .open();
		
		for (Olive o : olives) {
			System.out.println("It's a " + o.oliveName + " olive!!");
		}
	}


	Enum classes-a special type of class that can be used to contain values that serve as constants. 
	
	
	public enum OliveName {
	KALAMATA("Kalamata"), LIGURIO("Ligurio"), 
	PICHOLINE("Picholine"), GOLDEN("Golden");
	
	private String nameAsString;
	
	private OliveName(String nameAsString) {
		this.nameAsString = nameAsString;
	}
	
	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return this.nameAsString;
	}
}

Reflection-

		Class<?> c = o.getClass();
		
		System.out.println(c);
		System.out.println(c.getName());
		System.out.println(c.getSimpleName());
HashSet- unorderd set
treeset- ordered set- must implement comparable interface

LinkedList-order list and add objects at any position in the list

the LinkedList class can help you manage objects in a finer way than the ArrayList.
 It gives you the ability to add objects in specific locations of the collection, and it will retain that order as long as the collection stays in memory.
 
 Bufferstreams - used for putting objects in memory an out
 buffered classes, you get improved memory management and a more efficient use of system resources.
 
 	BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("hamlet.xml"));
				BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("newfile.txt"));
 
 
 byte input streams- y (
				FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("flower.jpg");
				FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("newflower.jpg");

charactert streams-	FileReader in = new FileReader("textfile.txt");
				FileWriter out = new FileWriter("newfile.txt");
 
 files- fileinput
 
 scanning file -
 	Scanner s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("tokenizedtext.txt")));
				) {
			s.useDelimiter(",");
			
The scanner class can be used to easily read this sort of tokenized text, 
and it works well to read very large files, grab the text from those files already separated, and then process the text as needed in your application.


Threads-
in order to create multiple threads, you can either create your new classes that extend a class called thread, or you can implement an interface.
create your own custom class that extends thread, add your own functionality to the custom run method, and then instantiate the class and start it from your main process.

public class MyThread extends Thread {

	@Override
	public void run() {
		int iterations = 5;
		
		try {
			for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
				System.out.println("From secondary thread");
				sleep(2000);
			}
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			System.err.println(e);
		}
	}
	
}
Thread implement Runnable interface

public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {

	@Override
	public void run() {
		int iterations = 5;
		
		try {
			for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
				System.out.println("From runnable");
				Thread.sleep(1500);
			}
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			System.err.println(e);
		}
	}

}

to start thread
	MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
		new Thread(runnable).start();
		
Interupting a thread-
	t.interrupt();
	
Synchronzing threads-

Now here's an important thing. Notice that I'm creating a single instance of the target object, 
and I'm passing that same reference into all three thread objects. So when we get into the thread synchronization, \
they're all examining the same target object to synchronize on, because all three classes are using the same target object, and it's important that they be exactly the same reference, only one of those objects will be able to execute the synchronized code at a time, and because I have the sleep command in there, the other two will have to wait, and they'll go at 2-second intervals.


	public class MyThread extends Thread {

	private int threadId;
	private TargetClass target;
	
	public MyThread(int threadId, TargetClass target) {
		this.threadId = threadId;
		this.target = target;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run() {

		synchronized(target) {
			try {
				sleep(2000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			target.call(threadId);
		}
		

	}

}
