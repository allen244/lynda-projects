Spring Fraemwork-
-Framework to provide comprehensive infrastructural support for developing enterprise applications
-Provides the plumbing and we build the business logic
-removes all boiler plate code

Spring also promotes good object-oriented practices, as well as do-not-repeat-yourself (DRY) principles because they're really baked into the framework. 
Well-defined interface definitions, leveraging dependency injection, and the concepts of true POJOs, are really part of that object-oriented programming practice.

POjo (plain java object)- has both attributes and behaviors. Doesnt have to be just getters and setters

JavaBean- A simple POJO whose only behavior is getters and setters

DTO - Is javaBneah whose purpose is transport data from layer to another

Boiler plate code removal examples-
The amount of code that Spring saves us by its inversion of control container is immense. 
Data access is actually one of the areas that I think you will see the largest removal of boilerplate code, especially when we're dealing with transaction boundaries, rollback segments and connection management.
 We also can find removal of these boilerplate sections when dealing with security, messaging, remote access, caching, and many other J2EE integrations.
 -Controller integration throuhg the mvn pattern.
 
 Aspecting-
 Now aspecting adds common behavior to a class at runtime or compile time. 
 And this is really what Spring leverages in order to remove all of that boilerplate function. 
 Spring utilizes aspecting for almost all of its abstractions and actually since 4.0, any class whether you write it or whether Spring wrote it in the framework, that are managed by the ApplicationContext are proxied or aspected in some way.
 
ApplicationContext- 
ApplicationContext really is the heart and soul of a Spring application. At its core, it is a BeanFactory that stores all of the objects that Spring manages, all of those definitions and the proxies around them. It then uses a factory pattern to serve those beans through the inversion of control operations to your objects themselves.
 And as I said, it's the heart and soul because it contains every piece of information, every object definition, every instance of what it manages during the life cycle of a Spring application.
 
 Spring BOOT-
-rapid application development
-removes boilerplate code of just gettign and app to run
-cloud native ready but runs in traditional enviorment
-Spring boot produces and executale jar that contaions all of the dependencies needed for an application

-Embedded tocmat app server
-auto-config and component scanning in an appropriates application context
-automatic servlet mappings- And with Spring the servlet that we are specifically going to be dealing with is the dispatcher servlet that will handle all URL requests to our root context.
-embedded databases and dml-ddl
-hibernate
-controller mappings
-annotations

Skelton for spring boot projects can be built here - http://start.spring.io/

Acuator plugin- Use security and dont expose to the outside world

http://localhost:8080/env- shows the enivorment of the application
http://localhost:8080/beans- shows all the beans loaded
applications.properties- can ovverided any of the defaults

This prop is used spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none - to tell the default not to generate a schema

Spring Data-
-Provides a common set of interfaces for a varitey of datasources and no sql
-naming method
-repository and data mapping abstractions
-reduces boilerplate code
-provides ability to swap out datasoucres much easier
-allows to focus on business logic and not data access code

Kye components-
Repository- interface that goes to repository data pattern- CrudRepository and PagingAndSortRepository
entity- object that represents the table or document

Buildong of a service abstraction
-Yields cleaner code with separation concerns
-Allows you to expose data in more than one way
-In RDBMS scenarios allows to build complex transactions

Spring mvc
Model -data being served out
view- visual what the user sees
controller- traffic cop that collects data for the model an passes it to the view
@controller
-responses to all requests throuhg RequestMapping- DispatcherServlet
-Controls building the model and resolving the view

Restful endpoints
RestController-
-Provides RequestMapping interface to dispatcher
-Controls url to method mapping
-Provies model to view mapping

Difference with controllers
-Responsse body
-returns an object instead of string that is xml or json
-With Spring HATEOAS can provide hypermedia representations using hal


1. Spring startup
2. Spring data
3. Sproing service
