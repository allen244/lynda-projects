Selectors and filters-Selectors and Filters provide a way of finding and extracting information from Web pages

Selectors are used to select parts of the Web page using a common CSS-style syntax.

For example, $("p") will select all of the paragraph tags in a document and return them as a list that can be further operated upon



Filters are used to further refine the results returned from selectors.

For example, $("p:first") will select the first paragraph in the returned set from $("p").
