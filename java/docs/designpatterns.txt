Design Patterns- solutions to general problems
-Help structure my code so that its flexible
-guide line for how to solve a problem
-reuse code
help with changes in the spec down the road




------------------ Strategy pattern ----------------
Inheritance- "is a"  feline -> cat and tiger

Problems with inheritance-

interfaces- allow differnt classed to share similarities
-not all classes need the same behavior

Design principle 1- Identify the aspects of your code that vary and separate them from what stays the same

Encapsulate what varies?
if some aspect of the code keeps chagning- that a sign to pull out the code and sparater it

By separating out the parts of the code - You can extend or alter them without affecting the rest of the code

all patterns let some part of the code vary independenlty of the other parts- few surprised from code changes and increase flexiblity in your code

Design Principle 2- program to an interface, not an implementation

Has a relationship - duck has a fly behavor and quack behavior

-this way we are no longer locked into specific implementations

Using inheritance for the behaviors that done change and composition that are more flexible

Strategy pattern- defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorthm vary independently from clients that use it

Using inheritance for the behaviors that done change and composition that are more flexible

Duck has many behaviors- has a fly behaviro quack. and can use inheritances for regular display so we are using both inheritance and composition "is a" and "has a"

Has a -is composition duck has a quack behaviro

Design principle 3- Favor composition has a over inheritance is a becasue- 
iheritance you are locked in at compile time
-compostion - can make use of any behaviro has a- more fleixble



------------------ Observer pattern ----------------
The observer pattern -s a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes stat all of its depnedents are notified and update automattically.
example - Publisher ---> many subscribers

Weatehr data is a subject- current condition, forecast, weather stats are the obsevers . They are dependant on the subject "weatehr data" when to update

Can create your own Subject interface or use the java build In observable interface

Loose coupling-Subject and observers are loosley coupled
-they interact- make coupled
-but have little know of each other - make them loosely coupled
-Loose coupling allows for more flexibale design- we dont have to updaet teh subject ever just the observers

Design principle 4- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact


------------------ Decorator pattern ----------------
Design principle 5- classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
Open closed principle
-Decorator patter- attached additinal responsibilties to a object dynamically. Decorators prodive flixble alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
Abstact class bevberage which gets extended by the decorator component
Example coffe cost for housblen - mocha- soy all call the cost method to calculate cost
exammple input strem reading
	InputStream in = 
				new LowerCaseInputStream(
					new BufferedInputStream(
						new FileInputStream("test.txt")));
						
		------------------ Singleton pattern ----------------
-Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it
-Need it for connection pools, logging tools, threads, device drivers
-Private contructor accessed through static method
Class------- not thread save two threads can access at the same time
	private Singleton() {}
 
	public static Singleton getInstance() {
		if (uniqueInstance == null) {
			uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
		}
		return uniqueInstance;
	}
Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();

Thread safe expenive synchronized method
	private static Singleton uniqueInstance;

 
	private Singleton() {}
 
	public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
		if (uniqueInstance == null) {
			uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
		}
		return uniqueInstance;
	}
static safe	- JVM Creates the one instance before the threads execute.
two threads cant access at the same time 
private static Singleton uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
 
	private Singleton() {}
 
	public static Singleton getInstance() {
		return uniqueInstance;
	}
	
	------------------ State pattern ---------------
state patter- allows and object alter its behavior when its interanal state changes. The object will apppear to change its class
-Write code based on states and transitions
-build a state interface with each actions
-each state object will implement the interface
example gumball machines

------------------ Iterator pattern ---------------
 The pattern gives you a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 
 Design principal 6- a class should have only one reason to change
 java iterator
 
 ------------------ Factory pattern ---------------
 Factory-Pizza factory that can produce many pizzas
 the factory class is what creates the new object or pizza
 
 factory method patter- defines and interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
 factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses
